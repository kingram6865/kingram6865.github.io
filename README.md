# About Me
Hello! I'm Ken Ingram.

I am a Software Engineer, based in the San Francisco Bay Area

I became fascinated with all types of technology at a young age, and computers have been the at the top of my list of interests. I have a background in science, with a degree in Applied Mathematics, focusing on Statistics. I worked for a time in operations in a Site Reliability Engineering role.
                            
I enjoy learning new technologies that can be used in the field of computer science and software engineering, and determining ways to use these technologies to solve problems. These days I am most curious about AI and Blockchain, and developing API's, Microservices, infrastructure and front ends for applications.
                            
I became an independent contractor so that I could take more time to study full-time with my Eskrima teacher. I am a lineage holder in the Filipino martial art Visayan Style Corto Kadena Eskrima, a system designed, developed and cultivated by my late teacher Grandmaster Santiago "Sonny" Umpad. 
                            
I also enjoy spending time as a sous chef of gourmet dinners for groups of 20-25 people bi-monthly for the last 10 years. In my remaining spare time my avocation is legal research to understand the history of the legal process behind American government and American society.
